# Caioob Dotfiles
This is a collection of my dotfiles for my Arch Linux installation.
Most of my configuration files are based on Luke Smith's [**larbs**](https://larbs.xyz/) with a few modifications. 
Files that I've modified or for programs not included in **larbs** can be found on this repository. 
For configuration files for programs not included in this repository please reffer to Luke Smith's [voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice) repository.
